# Repetition
My third Java assignment for Programming 1 (COMP 1501) involving repetition (loops).

## Problem 1 Scenario: Projectile Motion Revisited

For this problem, let us revisit the projectile motion problem in Assignment 1.  In that assignment, you were asked to calculate the Time of Flight, the Maximum Height and the Horizontal Range of a projectile that was launched with an Initial Velocity at a given angle.  For this assignment, you will perform the same calculations for different angles.

## Problem 2 Scenario: Pricing Inventory

A certain company uses a six-digit integer as an inventory code to identify inventory items.  Rather than just use random six-digit codes, they have decided that the first 2 digits should refer to the type of inventory item.  For example, 11 might refer to dairy items, 21 for canned goods, etc.  The last 4 digits are random digits that signify the inventory number.  In order to make their reporting more meaningful, they would like to separate the two sets by a dash (-).  For example, inventory code 123456 would be printed out as 12-3456.

## Problem 3 Scenario: Depreciation

Any capital asset, such as equipment, depreciates over time.   There are many ways to calculate depreciation.  One of the methods used to calculate depreciation is the double declining balance method.  For information about double declining balance method and to see an example, please refer to the following:  https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/2017/5/17/double-declining-balance-depreciation or you can search for other websites using Google.

Normally, in an organization, there are a number of assets that are depreciated.  Your task is to create a program that will determine the yearly depreciation and ending book value of each asset.
